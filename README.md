# Rusty Coin

Rust library containing a collection of financial functions and calculations including, but not limited to...
* Time Value of Money
* Cash Flow
* Interest Rates
* Currency/Conversions

This is my first pass at a Rust library. I figured it would be fun to refresh my background in finance while playing around with Rust.
